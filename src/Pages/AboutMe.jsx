                    Hello! My name is Rene Ortega Jr. As of today, I can proudly
                    say, "I found my passion"! Before even considering becoming
                    a Web Developer, I worked as a Construction Foreman/Quality
                    Control specialist. To be honest, I was unhappy. After three
                    hard years of my life, while I was a student studying
                    structural engineering, I stepped my foot down and
                    discontinued that journey. I was born in Orlando, FL. Where
                    I currently live. I want to move out of state and start a
                    new life elsewhere, preferably in Salt Lake City, Utah.
                    Mainly for the snow and cold temperatures and the tech
                    industry in Utah. As a big believer in Family being a part
                    of my life, I spend with my loved ones and my girlfriend
                    Natalie! My interests outside of work are my health passions
                    and taking care/growing my plants and succulents.
                  </p>
